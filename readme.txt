== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How to save raw page or post? =

Easily. You can use all default buttons like `Update Raw`, `Publish Raw` and `Save Draft`.
Only if `Raw Content` tab is selected/open it will save that content.

= Does it sync with other editors? =

No. On that side this plugin is independent. It will pull content from database as is and it won't sync it to other editors.

= It doesn't work with other plugins. =

It should work unless they are also changing something on default WP content editor.

= What browsers do you recommend? =

My preference is using Chrome or Firefox and I would be happy to hear that it is working with other browsers too.
